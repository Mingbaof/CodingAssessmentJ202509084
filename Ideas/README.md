### Coding Assessment Requirements J202509084

- This is the rough plan out of the project, identifying the core requirements and user flow.
- If this is a more complex project maybe I would do some scooping of the work as well, but since this is trivial, each item in the `Deliverables` list should be a descriptive user story and the acceptance criteria should be obvious. Thus, no extra scooping is done.

### Pre/Post Design Diagram:

- There are `Pre Design Diagram` and `Architecutre & High Level Design`, the first one is just some initial design after I implemented the strcuture of the repo and the packages(modules). The later one is drawn with more details after I completed the assessment.
- User flow is simple, so no Sequence diagrams are needed.
